This is simple browser application written on Qt & QtWebkit.

Versions:

- 1.05 supports Qt5,

- 1.04 supports Qt4.


Usualy runing in fullscreen mode, but supports maximized and fixed size window mode.

This browser uses **only one** application window. So, **no** popups, **no** plugins in separate processes, like Chrome do.

Supports several parameters via configuration file: proxy, user-agent, click sound.

Also supports hiding printer dialog and uses default or defined printer.
